    <p>This website is dedicated <strong>the search
        for the smallest
        Kochen-Specker system</strong>.  See the
    section <em>The experiment</em> below,
  for an explanation what Kochen-Specker systems are and why they are
  interesting.  At the moment, this website primarily lists
  the results from <a href="/references.html#uw">a paper by Uijlen
      and Westerbaan</a>.  Please feel
  free to contribute: <a href="mailto:contact@kochen-specker.info">send
      an e-mail</a> or <a href="http://github.com/bwesterb/ks">contribute
              directly on github</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>The experiment</h2>
  <p>Consider the following experiment.  Measure the SPIN of a spin 1 particle
  along a direction.  Or more concretely: shoot a deuterium atom
  through a certain fixed inhomogeneous magnetic field.
  Depending on the direction it was shot through the field,
  the particle will move undisturbed
  or deviate.</p>
  <p>Quantum Mechanics only predicts the probability, given the
  direction, whether the particle will deviate.  Its probabilistic
  prediction has been tested thoroughly.  One wonders: is there a deterministic
  theory predicting the outcome of this experiment?</p>
  <p>Kochen and Specker <a href="/references.html#ks">have shown</a>
  that any such deterministic theory
  must be odd: it cannot 
  satisfy the plausible (non contextual) SPIN axiom,
  that is: in exactly two out of three pairwise orthogonal directions
  the particle will deviate.</p>
  <p>They have proven this by giving 117 points on the sphere,
  representing 117 directions,
  for which there can be no special {0,1}-valued coloring
  (called a 010-coloring),
  which corresponds to the predictions of a deterministc theory.</p>

        title="Conway's 31 Kochen-Specker system" />
  <p>After Kochen and Speckers original paper,
  several people have tried to give a smaller set of points to demonstrate
  this fact.  Such a finite set of points is called a <strong>Kochen-Specker
      system</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Smallest Kochen-Specker system</h2>
  <p>The smallest <em>known</em> Kochen-Specker system is due to Conway.
  It has 31 points and is shown on the right.
  We also know that the smallest Kochen-Specker system must have
  at least 21 points.  A short history:</p>

  <h3>The lower bounds</h3>
  <p>Arends, Ouaknine and Wampler observed that a <em>n</em> point
  Kochen-Specker system corresponds to a certain <em>n</em> vertex graph:
  a graph that is both <em>(sphere) embeddable</em> and
  not <em>010-colorable</em>.
  They have shown there are no such graphs on less than 18 vertices.
  Uijlen and Westerbaan demonstrated that there is also no such graph
  on less than 21 vertices.</p>
